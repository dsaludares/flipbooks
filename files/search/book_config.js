Bahl\u00a0 Associate Vice Chancellor\u00a0\u00a0IT IS WITH GREAT PLEASURE that I share our Design, Facilities andSafety Services (DFSS) Annual Report for FY 2022. DFSS departments include:\u2022Business and Financial Planning. BFP provides financial andhuman resource support to all DFSS units for capital, operating andmaintenance projects totaling over $200 million and 350 FTEpositions. \u2022Design and Construction Services. DCS represents theUniversity in all aspects of capital development and improvementwith the goal of creating quality, efficient, safe and sustainablefacilities respectful of the region\u2019s unique and sensitiveenvironment.\u2022Environmental Health and Safety. EHS provides guidance andservices to the campus community to promote the integration ofhealth, safety, and environmental stewardship to all Universityactivities.\u2022Facilities Management. FM provides operations andmaintenance services to the core campus. Its focus is on the statesupported, general-funded buildings and infrastructure including 4million gross square feet and over 260 acres of grounds whilemaintaining the energy needs of the campus in a sustainablemanner.In DFSS we aim to work seamlessly to provide needed support toenhance UC Santa Barbara\u2019s education and research mission. FiscalYear 2022 was a year full of accomplishments and initiatives whichyou will read about in the ensuing pages. While DFSS shines inaccomplishing planned projects, we are also proven in respondingto unexpected situations. We continue to make great progress on becoming a moresustainable campus by reducing our potable water usage andprocuring green energy to supply our main campus. You will learnmore about these accomplishments in our article on sustainability. Our largest capital project \u2013 the Interactive Learning Pavilion \u2013which will add 2,000 additional seats for instruction, remains ontime and on budget with an opening date for Spring quarter 2023despite global supply chain delays. Our achievements, planned and unplanned, are due to our tenets ofcustomer service, telling our story, and a valued workforce.We strive to provide excellent customer service through relationshipbuilding, communication, and technology. Our customer servicethis year was exemplified through our continued work on campuswhether we were meeting in-person or virtually. We work as one DFSS team to tell our story about our excellent workto be the pride of UC Santa Barbara. We participate in Town Halls,lead collaboration meetings with campus partners, meet regularlywith stakeholders to receive feedback and share successes, anddevelop tools to improve our customers\u2019 understanding of what wedo and how we can help. In DFSS we also tell our story by what yousee, not what you hear. The well-maintained grounds, cleanbuildings, safe campus, and capital improvement projects are allabout our story.We value our workforce through recognition, training, growthopportunities, and open communications so staff choose to stay inDFSS. The Acknowledging Commitment and Excellence (ACE)program recognizes DFSS staff and partners who makeextraordinary efforts on campus and are recommended by acommittee and awarded through the leadership team.Thank you for reading about our FY 2022 accomplishments.

","FM Grounds updated the landscape at theHSSB Courtyard by incorporating new trees,and a landscape that can be utilized as anoutdoor learning space. The trees are allnative to California, and include a GiantSequoia and two Dawn Redwoods","SUSTAINABILITYUniversity of California (UC), a national leader in sustainability, haspledged to become carbon neutral by 2025, becoming the first majoruniversity to accomplish this achievement. Global climate disruptionis impacting the planet in ways never experienced in human history.UCSB's culture of environmental sustainability remains a drivingforce for continuous improvement, and we seek to build uponprevious conservation efforts by providing accurate, real-timebuilding energy and water monitoring to facilitate the nextgeneration of conservation campaigns at UCSB.At UCSB, we think globally and act locally. Our successful efforts toprocure green electricity, reduce reliance on natural gas, decreasepotable water use and achieve higher LEED certifications have madeus a leader in the field.Clean Power ProgramIn 2015, UC was officially designated as a California Energy ServiceProvider, giving UC the ability to buy and sell in the wholesale powermarket. In 2020, when the world was grappling with COVID, UCSBhad the opportunity to join the UC Clean Power Program and is nowthe third largest member in the UC system as measured by annualpower use. The Clean Power Program electricity generation portfolioconsists primarily of wind and solar power with a small amount ofhydropower and nuclear which results in electricity use on our maincampus being carbon free. Reduction in Natural Gas UseAs of July 2019, new buildings being constructed at UCSB aredesigned without the use of natural gas for heating and hot watergeneration and relying instead on electricity. We continue to look for opportunities to build out our chilled and hot water systems tominimize the need for natural gas to heat campus buildings.Recycled WaterOver 90% of our landscape irrigation uses recycled water. Not onlyare we saving valuable potable drinking water, but recycled water isan unstressed water source in our community and is provided to theUniversity in partnership with Goleta Sanitary District and GoletaWater District.On a typical year, our campus uses approximately 80,000 hundredcubic feet (HCF) of recycled water for our irrigation systems and inBren Hall with its dual-plumbed toilets. This equates to water thatwould fill 80 Olympic-sized swimming pools! These waterconservation efforts are helping both locally and regionally duringthis extreme drought. LEEDThe UC Sustainable Practices Policy requires that all new UCbuildings achieve a US Green Building Council Leadership in Energy& Environmental Design (LEED) \u201cSilver\u201d certification at a minimum.The four levels of LEED certification, from lowest to highest, areCertified, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Since adding over six megawattsof onsite solar power beginning in 2016, all eligible campus buildingprojects have achieved a LEED Platinum rating, including the mostrecently certified building on the UCSB campus, Henley Hall.We are honored and committed to weave sustainability into all ourefforts to make UCSB a world-class facility to learn, live and work notjust for today but for generations to come.
